doc.add_paragraph("This report presents the results of an exercise on Recurrent Neural Networks, where models of minimal size are employed on a stock forecasting problem. An introduction to this problem is given, along with some practical considerations. The dataset is defined and its preparation is explained. Several small topologies are tested, and the results are presented both in an aggregate sense and in detail for sample models. An investment strategy based on these predictions is simulated, which presents low to negative returns. Final notes are given in the conclusion.")

    "In this work, several Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are trained on a time series extracted from Yahoo Finance for a ticker traded in the Brazilian stock market. The forecast attempts to use current market data of an asset to predict its lowest trading price twenty financial days later. The idea being that if the trading price of a stock could be known twenty days in advance, a buy/sell decision could be made on spot, and profits could be earned by generating accurate enough predictions. Using a gap of twenty days attempts to remove the fact that the markets are believed to be dominated by volatility and extreme events on a daily basis, but asset prices should be driven by their intrinsic value over longer periods of time, while in the mean term a mixture of the momentum of market dynamics and the underlying properties of the market, hence a period of twenty financial days, which is approximately one calendar month should accommodate for meaningful fluctuations, while neither attempting to predict fluctuations dominated by randomness nor attempting to guess evolutions of the long term market and business reality."

doc.add_paragraph(
    "Stock forecasting is a very difficult problem for real life applications, since any trivial method to forecast stock prices in the short or medium term, once deployed to the real market opposes its own effectiveness, that is, purchasing an asset causes it's price to rise while selling it causes the price to drop. Since many players act on the market, if several of them employ the same technique, their execution will degrade in quality to the point of distorting the market away from behaving as the technique assumed. Despite this fact, the goal in the current project is to experiment with the smallest possible recurrent networks to address this problem."

    'A validation set is created using the 10% most recent data, while the 10% oldest data is used for test and the rest is used for training. Several models are trained and the scored are saved in a .csv file in the "Results" folder. One of the goals in this exercise was to find the smallest possible model that would yield satisfactory results for the problem at hand. While, as discussed before, the problem is intrinsically difficult and using large models would be acceptable as long as the training and activation were feasible, due to this secondary goal of the exercise, a list of possible topologies was created with the script "manipulations.py", is located in the folder "models", named "Layers_by_complexity.csv", and it specifies the amount of parameters each topology contains if it represented a standard Multi-Layer Perceptron network (MLP), despite LSTM cells being used. This is meant to provide a simple proxy to how "big" or "small" a model is. Each model has 7 neurons in an input layer and 1 in its output layer, which are often omitted when describing the topology. Topologies from the smallest to the highest complexity were tested, but were limited to 5 inner layers with at most 25 neurons each. Because of the long training times, in which many models took over 20 minutes to train, and because other operations also took considerably long, it was not possible to exhaust all the listed topologies, with most of the simplest ones being tested, and some models being skipped so it would be possible to also attempt training more complex models, which nevertheless, remained relatively simple. The aforementioned file in the "Results" folder is not overwritten if the script "PredictTicker.py" is rerun, as it checks this file for already trained models, so it is simple to fill the gaps left in the group of trained topologies should it be demanded.'

Normally one would expect very good results on training data, since the models were fit into this dataset, moderately good results on validation date since the best models were selected partially based on the results obtained on the validation set (which is the latest trading data) and poor results on the test data, which for this exercise is composed of the first part of the time series, which is not included in the training set.')

doc.add_paragraph('The proposed strategy consists of the following procedure: The model is run every night without retraining using all available data. This allows using data of that financial day, and create a prediction for the minimum trading price of the asset twenty financial days later. If the prediction surpasses the closing price by more than a given relative value, i.e 5%, then an investment of one monetary unit is made. Otherwise no position is taken. Because it is only possible to operate on the following financial day, the asset is assumed to be bought on the highest trading price of the consecutive day, and whatever happens, it is sold on the financial day for which the prediction was made at the lowest trading price of that day. This is a simple, if not na√Øve strategy based on a prediction which does have an associated time window, despite the fact that most asset forecasts avoid giving a precise and especially short term target date for a predicted value. Also, the assumption of buying on the highest trading price of the following day while selling at the lowest price of the prediction day is deliberately pessimistic, which is meant to safe-guard the strategy against poor execution of either the trader or automated system that would perform the operations. This however does not prevent large operations by this strategy to meaningfully affect the price of the asset, thus being probably a realistic scenario at small trading volumes relative to the liquidity of the asset, but an unrealistic method for very large amounts or illiquid assets.')

doc.add_paragraph('Using the aforementioned strategy, the profit is computed by assuming that exactly one financial unit was invested on each day that the relative gain criterion was satisfied. A distinction is made between the predicted profit and the feasible profit, in the sense that the predicted one is the profit that could be earned if the asset traded on the prediction date exactly at the price forecast by the model, while the feasible profit happens when the asset is sold at the value corresponding to the actual trading data. For simplicity of interpretation, the profit is added at the time of the investment, not at the time the asset would be sold. This allows visualizing how aggressively or inertly the strategy behaves by differentiating times when the strategy creates new positions and periods when it doesn\'t make any movements. To provide a relative value, a cumulative Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) chart is also plotted, and the return rate on each piece of the timeseries is computed for as an annualized return rate and mentioned on the paragraphs below, thus allowing a closer comparison between performances between datasets and topologies. It is important to notice, however, that if an asset were to always increase in price, the strategy would never lose money whatever it did. Also, any annualized return below 5% can be understood to be lower than a relatively small equity risk premium, whereas the return on a risky investment should surpass both this premium value and the risk free rate, which in Brazil, for the period between the years of 1999 and 2021 has varied between 45% and 2% a year. Also, note that these returns and profits make no assumption of compounding, the invested amount at any day has no relation with previous earnings or losses, which is unusual in traditional investing, although day traders often design strategies that require a fixed and relatively small invested capital, due to the lack of scalability of the strategy.')

doc.add_heading("First Model Results", level=3)
doc.add_paragraph(f"The first model tested has the topology (7, 1, 1), that is, only a single LSTM neuron between the input and output layers. Naturally, it was expected to train relatively well, but to generalize poorly. The reason for this assumption is that the optimization algorithm should be able to find a direct descent path more easily, although it might not yield the best results, nor encode any sophisticated logic. Additionally, some visually good results may be the outcome of simply predicting a future price as being very close to the latest prices, which while reasonable to reduce quadratic error is a completely useless prediction method to employ on an investment strategy. Apparently, something similar to this is happening as the predictions seem to be following the actual values with a delay.")

doc.add_paragraph(f"The ticker {ticker} was chosen for a myriad of reasons, one of them being the fact that the lack of a consistent upward trend should prevent good results coming from checking a broken clock at the right time of the day, meaning, good results for this ticker would be unlikely to be the effect of a coincidence or the fact that the proposed strategy would always be profitable no matter the accuracy of the prediction if the asset would always appreciate over the period of twenty financial days. As explained in the introduction, the prediction problem for a financial asset is inherently difficult, and no quantitative strategy, especially one designed to be relatively simple should perform consistently over long periods of time. All that being said, the results currently obtained were significantly underwhelming, which is mostly due to the fact that as the correlation graphs show, there is little generalization capacity for the limited size of the models tested. The thresholds applied for the investment strategy do not seem to point towards there existing some sweet spot number, being too conservative when the threshold is high and though not so aggressive when the threshold is low, but nonetheless no result found for annualized return on invested capital were above a reasonable equity risk premium, let alone a proper target return rate. The exercise nonetheless allowed experimenting with time series forecasting and Long Short-Term Memory neural networks, and develop some first hand experience in implementing and training them.")
